Topic: Digital Connectivity in Nigeria.

This project seeks to examine the intersection of educational access and digital connectivity, 
2 key factors that contribute to the UN Datathonâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals of Digital Connectivity and Quality Education.

The first part of the analysis is a spatial analysis of digital connectivity. We examine patterns between schools in Nigeria and the
Communications Risk Access Score per LGA, using ArcGIS and R. 

Next, using the Nigerian General Household Survey, Panel 2018-2019, Wave 4, we explore how internet use and mobile phone use varies by
education level. In particular, we used the following data files:

sectc1_plantingw4: Data collected through Post Planting Community Questionnaire, Section C1 (Respondent Characteristics)
sect4b_plantingw4: Data collected through Post Planting Household Questionnaire, Section 4B (ICT - Mobile Phone Banking)

Documentation on the General Household Survey can be found here: https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/3557/data-dictionary 

We also show how digital connectivity varies by urban/rural populations, and which locations are more in demand by individuals when accessing
the internet, which is key for policymakers in both fostering rural-urban linkages, and improving connectivity in Nigeria.
